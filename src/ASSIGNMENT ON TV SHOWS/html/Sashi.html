<h4>    Sashi - Synopsis
</h4>
    <p>

        Raj(Aadi Saikumar) is a carefree youth who is not at all serious in life. The entire burden of his family is born by his brother Ajay(Ajay). Raj has an interest in music and this is also the time, he spots Sashi(Surabhi) and falls in love with her. But the twist in the tale arises when Sashi falls into problems and Raj also gets connected to them. How Raj and Sashi face these problems and come out is the story of the film.
        
        Aadi Sai Kumar has done quite well in his role. With this film, he has improved a lot in his performances. His role had a good scope for him to perform and Aadi did well in his character which had a lot of variations. Heroine Surabhi was exceptional and proved that she is not just a pretty face but can also act well.
        
        Yet another heroine, Raasi Singh also did well in her role. She was quite good in all the tense scenes of the film. Comedians Harsha and Vennela Kishore do well in their roles. Rajeev Kanakala and his character are also good to see on screen. The emotions in key scenes work to an extent    </p>
