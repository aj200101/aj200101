    <h4>    Uyir Ulla Varai Kadhal -  Synopsis
    </h4>

    <p>A middle class boy Sanju (Ram) from Kakinada comes to Hyderabad for his IT job. While he stays in the house of a family friend Vishwanath (Prakash Raj) in the city, Sanju falls for his daughter Anupama soon. Tension prevails in the house. Yet, the rapport between Sanju and Vishwanath promises some fun and here's a predictable terrain that's however enjoyable for a viewer.Anupama holds her own despite being in a script that mostly explores the male pysche and shows she can groove well too. Pranitha was never known her meaty parts in the past and her miniscule role in Uyir Ulla Varai Kadhal too doesn't help her case. Devi Sri Prasad's music that seemed underwhelming prior to the film's release works better on-screen, most songs are visualised and executed well.
