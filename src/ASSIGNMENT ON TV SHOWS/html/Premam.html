    <h4>Premam - Synopsis</h4>

    <p>
        Malar, a college lecturer, reignites his love interest as George's first romance ends in disappointment. Through numerous stages of his amorous journey, he discovers his calling. Sai Pallavi, who plays the guest lecturer Malar, threatens to steal the show. She portrays a young lecturer tentatively seizing upon love for her student, conveying missives through her eyes that move like a ballerina. The supporting cast is flawless, be it Vinay who comes as a fumbling, finicky, love-stricken lecturer or Krishna and Shabareesh who play George’s friends. Anand’s frames soothe the eyes, mixing tonalities well and giving a slight jerkiness to initial scenes that go well with the shaky nature of a teenager.
        Alphonse can be forgiven for the flimsy conclusions he makes on certain episodes of love because he does it with the knack of a magician, giving hardly any time to think it over. This is a movie with a high likeability quotient because it unearths the beauty in trifles.
